//BASIC THEORY

//AJAX : Asynchronous javascript and XML

/*
XML - stands for eXtensible Markup language, much like HTML
    - XML is just information wrapped in tags.
        - XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
        - HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
*/

/*
Main focus should be on HTTP request not in AJAX

- our browser acts as a client and there is server in the backend
- client requests server for some data transmission, which is done using HTTP
*/

/*
- AJAX is a set of "web development techniques"
- used in client-side to create asynchronous web application
*/

/*
- with AJAX, web application can send and retrieve data from server asynchronously (in the background)
  without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page 
*/

/*
- we dont use data in XML format anymore
- now we use JSON most of the time (sometimes csv file)
*/

/*
- we have three most common ways to create and send request to server
    1. xmlHTTPRequest (XHR) (old way of doing) [AJAX Request]
    2. fetch API (new way of doing) [HTTP Request]
    3. axios (this is third party library)
